# HighSchoolSimulator
This started as a fun project to get away from doing school but after dumping roughly 10-12 hours into it in 2 days I decided to try to flesh it out and publish it.
## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
This game has been tested in Google Chrome and Internet Explorer. It will work in Internet Explorer, but some CSS properties will not be supported, resulting in blurry images. Firefox has not been tested at this point.
### Usage
Click on the github pages link in the sidebar to play in your browser.  
**Known issues**  
Github pages does not play nice with the function to control the end of the game. Also, it has trouble finding one particular image.
## Deployment
This will eventually be packaged with Electron to be installed locally like any other app.
